Conveniently close or open comments for a post or page with one click.

== Description ==

Conveniently close or open comments for a post or page with one click.

From the admin listing of posts ('Edit Posts') and pages ('Edit Pages'), a user can close or open comments to any posts to which they have sufficient privileges to make such changes (essentially admins and post authors for their own posts).  This is done via an AJAX-powered color-coded indicator.  The color-coding gives instant feedback on the current status of the post for comments: green means the post/page is open to comments, red means the post/page is closed to comments.  Being AJAX-powered means that the change is submitted in the background without requiring a page reload.

This plugin will only function for administrative users in the admin who have JavaScript enabled.


== Installation ==

1. Unzip `one-click-close-comments.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory for your site
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
1. When on the 'Edit Posts' or 'Edit Pages' admin pages, click the indicators to toggle the comment status for a post, as necessary.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

This plugin only works for users that have JavaScript enabled.
